# CrowdChain â€“ Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

CrowdChain is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built with Next.js, Thirdweb, and Solidity. It enables campaign creators to raise funds transparently, while ensuring that contributors retain control over how funds are released through on-chain community voting.

This project is deployed on the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet and requires a Web3 wallet like MetaMask and some test ETH to interact.

## Wallet Requirement

To use the platform, a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask is required. It is used for:

- Creating or funding campaigns
- Voting on fund release proposals
- Withdrawing funds (for campaign owners)

MetaMask can be downloaded at [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io).

## Sepolia Testnet Requirement

CrowdChain runs on the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet. You will need test ETH in your wallet to interact with the application.

Get Sepolia test ETH from the official faucet:
[https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)

Make sure your MetaMask is connected to the Sepolia network before using the app.
